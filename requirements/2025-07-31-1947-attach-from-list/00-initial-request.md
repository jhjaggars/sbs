# Initial Request

**Date:** 2025-07-31 19:47
**Request:** when in the list view, you should be able to attach to a running session

## Original Context
User wants to enhance the SBS (Sandbox Sessions) CLI application to allow attaching to running sessions directly from the list view interface, rather than requiring separate commands.
